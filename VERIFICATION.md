# Implementation Verification Report

## Overview
This document verifies that all requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented.

## Problem Statement Requirements

### ✅ 1. Project Setup
**Requirement:** Update `pom.xml` to `<groupId>com.group_5.le6</groupId>`. Refactor the package to `com.group_5.le6` and add comments with your names (Agapito, Virtucio).

**Implementation:**
- ✅ pom.xml contains `<groupId>com.group_5.le6</groupId>` (line 7)
- ✅ All Java files are in package `com.group_5.le6`
- ✅ All Java files contain comment `// Authors: Agapito, Virtucio` at the top
  - App.java (line 3)
  - Student.java (line 3)
  - StudentController.java (line 3)
  - Attendance.java (line 3)
  - AttendanceController.java (line 3)

### ✅ 2. Student CRUD
**Requirement:** Add **Edit/Delete** buttons. **Delete** removes the selected student. **Edit** opens a new dialog, using `bindBidirectional` to link fields to the student's properties.

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **Edit Button Added:** Present in student-view.fxml (line 60)
  - Action: `onAction="#editStudent"`
  - Opens a Dialog with student information fields
  
- ✅ **Delete Button Added:** Present in student-view.fxml (line 61)
  - Action: `onAction="#deleteStudent"`
  - Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Removes student from the ObservableList
  
- ✅ **Bidirectional Binding in Edit Dialog:** (StudentController.java, lines 129-133)
  ```java
  idEdit.textProperty().bindBidirectional(student.idProperty(), new javafx.util.converter.NumberStringConverter());
  nameEdit.textProperty().bindBidirectional(student.nameProperty());
  emailEdit.textProperty().bindBidirectional(student.emailProperty());
  courseEdit.textProperty().bindBidirectional(student.courseProperty());
  ```
  - Changes in text fields immediately update student properties
  - Changes persist when OK is clicked
  - Changes are reverted when Cancel is clicked

- ✅ **Student Model with JavaFX Properties:** (Student.java)
  - Uses IntegerProperty for ID
  - Uses StringProperty for name, email, and course
  - Provides property accessors for bidirectional binding

### ✅ 3. Attendance System
**Requirement:** Create a new FXML and controller for attendance. Add a button to switch scenes. Use `Alert` dialogs for login errors.

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **New FXML Created:** attendance-view.fxml
  - Contains login form (username and password fields)
  - Contains attendance table with columns for Student ID, Name, Date, and Status
  - Has "Back to Students" button for navigation
  
- ✅ **New Controller Created:** AttendanceController.java
  - Handles login functionality
  - Manages attendance table data
  - Implements scene switching back to student view
  
- ✅ **Scene Switching Button:** 
  - Student view has "Go to Attendance" button (student-view.fxml, line 16)
  - Attendance view has "Back to Students" button (attendance-view.fxml, line 15)
  - Both buttons properly switch scenes using FXMLLoader
  
- ✅ **Alert Dialogs for Login Errors:** (AttendanceController.java)
  - Empty username/password: Shows ERROR Alert (line 63)
  - Invalid credentials: Shows ERROR Alert (line 72)
  - Successful login: Shows INFORMATION Alert (line 69)

## Additional Features Implemented

### Complete CRUD Operations
- ✅ **Create:** Add new students with validation
- ✅ **Read:** Display students in TableView
- ✅ **Update:** Edit student details using dialog with bidirectional binding
- ✅ **Delete:** Remove students with confirmation

### User Experience Enhancements
- ✅ Sample data pre-loaded for both students and attendance
- ✅ Input validation for all forms
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- ✅ Clear feedback through Alert dialogs
- ✅ Intuitive navigation between views

### Code Quality
- ✅ Proper JavaFX property usage for reactive UI
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Author attribution in all files
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (Model-View-Controller)
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Build Verification
- ✅ Project compiles successfully: `mvn clean compile`
- ✅ Project packages successfully: `mvn package`
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ No compilation errors
